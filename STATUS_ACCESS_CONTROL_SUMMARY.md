# Document Status-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive status-based access control for document editing and form submissions. When a document's status is set to "Processing", "Done", or "Cancelled", users are restricted from editing documents or submitting forms.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Document Dashboard (Frontend) Changes

#### Status Display
- Added status badges to document cards showing current status with color coding
- Status colors: Pending (Orange), Processing (Blue), Done (Green), Cancelled (Red)

#### View Documents Restrictions

- **Processing/Done Status**: Links work normally (full access to view documents)
- **Cancelled Status**: Links are crossed out and disabled with "Cancelled" indicator
- Applied CSS styling: `opacity: 0.5`, `text-decoration: line-through`, `pointer-events: none`

#### Forms Restrictions
- **Processing/Done Status**: 
  - Form links disabled with "Disabled" or "View Only" labels
  - Edit buttons become "View" buttons for existing submissions
  - Prevented new form submissions
- **Cancelled Status**:
  - All form links crossed out and disabled
  - "Cancelled" status indicator added
  - Complete prevention of form access

### 2. Form Page Access Control

#### Status Validation
- Added document status check in `render_form_page()` function
- Display warning banner when form access is restricted
- Show appropriate status message for each restriction type

#### Form Disabling
- When status is restricted:
  - Entire form disabled with `opacity: 0.6` and `pointer-events: none`
  - All form fields get `disabled` attribute
  - Submit button disabled and text changed to "Form Disabled" or "Form Cancelled"
  - JavaScript prevents form submission with status message alert

### 3. Backend Form Submission Protection

#### AJAX Handler Validation
- Added status check in `ajax_submit_form()` method
- Prevents form submission at server level even if frontend is bypassed
- Returns appropriate error messages for each status:
  - Processing: "Cannot submit form - document is currently being processed"
  - Done: "Cannot submit form - document has been completed" 
  - Cancelled: "Cannot submit form - document has been cancelled"

### 4. Visual Styling

#### CSS Classes Added
- `.disabled-link`: For processing/done status (grayed out, line-through)
- `.cancelled-link`: For cancelled status (red, crossed out)
- `.status-badge`: For status display in document cards
- Form styling for disabled states

#### Icons and Indicators
- Lock icon (üîí) for disabled links
- X icon (‚ùå) for cancelled links  
- Status-appropriate icons in form links (eye for view-only, edit for editable)
